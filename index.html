            <p>USS CANNON was named for the Astronomer Annie Jump Cannon (1863-1941), 
            who became known as the "census taker of the sky", was an American astronomer 
            who classified around 350,000 stars manually. She developed the Harvard spectral system, 
            which is used to classify stars today. Cannon inspired many women to work in astronomy, at 
            a time when gender biases greatly favored men in the space industry. USS CANNON was launch January 1st 2020. Earth had entered into a period of peace and prostarity
            after several years of unrest across the globe. The Earths population started to look more
            towards the stars and sent several large vessals out into deep space to explore and offer 
            peace offerings to any alien life encountered and report back with daily updates. These
            are it's logs.</p>
