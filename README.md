# StarDate Logs - USS CANNON #

## Description ##

This project is a story generater meant to let the user view different 
Captain Logs throughout the journey of the lesser known star fleet vessel the USS Cannon.

## Features ##

One solid main function runs through all the different arrays to result in a final Log. Extra features were added to give the website a more finished appearance
including some futuristic buttons and "console" (I hope to improve upon this in the future) Also I added sound to the button to really give it that future 90s feel.

## How To Use ##

Simply Click the button to have a randomly generated Captains Log appear with a unique story.

### Future Edits ###

I really want to add in the math to have the user enter a date of their choice and convert it into a star date.
